# DeskFit
A simple universal windows app to remind you to take breaks when at a desk.

# Recommended Hardware
When creating this app I made it in mind for a Raspberry Pi 3 running [Windows 10 IoT](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot) with a 5" touch screen (but the touch part doesn't work on Windows 10 IoT unfortunately).

- [x] Reminders every 30 minutes
- [x] Breaks with suggested random exercises
- [ ] Settings
    - [ ] A way to edit exercises
    - [ ] Change the length of breaks and the interval between them
